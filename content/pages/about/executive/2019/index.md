## Nominations for Deputy Chair

### [Patricia Mergen](https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2848-8231)

Meise Botanic Garden and Africamuseum Tervuren, Belgium

#### Background

I have been active in TDWG since 2002, had the position of Secretary for several turns and am currently chair of the [Time and Place Committee](https://www.tdwg.org/about/committees/tardis/). I have actively participated and managed projects around research infrastructures in the domain of Biodiversity Information and environmentally related topics, as well as in Natural History Collections. I am currently the contact for the Belgian National Task force for the ESFRI proposal [DiSSCo](http://dissco.eu/) (Distributed System of Scientific collections) and as liaison with other infrastructures such as this [e-LTER](http://www.lter-europe.net/), [LifeWatch](https://www.lifewatch.eu/), [DARIAH](http://be.dariah.eu/) and [E-RIHS](http://www.e-rihs.eu/). She is also following up the programs on the [European Open Science Cloud](https://www.eudat.eu/european-open-science-cloud) (EOSC) and [EU-DAT](https://eudat.eu/). I have expertise in Biodiversity Information standards and tools. Active member of the [Consortium of European Taxonomic Facilities](https://cetaf.org/) (CETAF) since 2005, sitting in the executive Committee from 2006 to 2015, currently involved as liaison between the different CETAF working groups. I have been involved since 2003 in the infrastructure project SYNTHESYS (Synthesis of Systematic resources) dealing with best practices in collection management and associated data and images.

In my PhD I applied Numerical Ecology, modelling and statistics. I am currently mentor and training provider for the [Global Biodiversity Information Facility EU project BID](https://www.gbif.org/programme/82243/bid-biodiversity-information-for-development) (Biodiversity Information for Development) where I am teaching about digitisation, data mobilisation, data cleaning, Geographic Information Systems, Niche modelling and IUCN Red list conservation status determinations and revisions aimed at policy maker users.

#### Vision for TDWG

As deputy chair and subsequently chair of TDWG, I will together with the executive committee and TDWG members, aim at having TDWG’s position reinforced and made more visible in the international biodiversity landscape. Notably the collaboration with GBIF, CETAF, DiSSCo, and other infrastructures will be continued and enhanced. New markets and users for TDWG standards will be identified. The process of ratification of standards will be continuously enhanced and speeded up to broaden the user base and the number of TDWG standards implemented by the communities. With my background and experience in fund raising and project management, I will also contribute to the mobilization of funds for TDWG and for example help with the access to European opportunities via its new European TDWG based branch.

### [Abby Benson](https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4391-107X)

United States Geological Survey, Colorado, United States

#### Curriculum Vitae

I have worked for the United States Geological Survey (USGS) since 2010 and I have been the node manager for the US Node to the Ocean Biogeographic Information System (OBIS) since 2015. I also served as co-chair for the Marine Biodata Task Team from 2015 – 2017. My interest is in the drivers and effects of changing ecosystems on organisms at national and global scales and the role management can play in mitigating deleterious effects. Concomitant with that is understanding the patterns of species diversity and how analyses involving data synthesis can expose patterns over broad spatial distributions and longer time scales. Inherit in these interests is the need for biodiversity information to be FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable) and biodiversity information standards play a key role in adhering to the FAIR Principles.

#### Vision Statement

TDWG has a unique position within the biodiversity information arena because biodiversity information standards provide the connection point between the people collecting data, managing data, and (re)using data. As such, the power of TDWG rests in making, fostering, and nurturing the connections between these three groups of people. As deputy chair and then chair of TDWG, I hope to identify new connections to cultivate with groups that may be underrepresented within TDWG and bolster collaborations that are already in place. As we invite ideas and critiques from current members and new ones, TDWG will find new avenues and directions to continue building a robust community of biodiversity information enthusiasts.

## Nominations for Secretary

### [Quentin Groom](https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0596-5376)

Meise Botanic Garden, Belgium 

#### Curriculum Vitae

I have broad experience in the plant sciences having originally worked in the UK and USA on the physiology, biophysics and molecular biology of photosynthesis and plant iron metabolism. Now I work in Belgium at [Meise Botanic Garden](http://www.plantentuinmeise.be/index.php) where I work at the interface of biodiversity science and information technology. I am currently part of a team digitizing and disseminating images of the Garden’s four million herbarium specimens. I take every opportunity to encourage data sharing and openness, though I am keen to ensure that data providers are adequately acknowledged and supported. Currently, I am leading the Open Science project [TrIAS](https://osf.io/7dpgr/) to create open workflows for the creation of policy ready information on invasive species from citizen science data. I am also working on the [ICEDIG](https://icedig.eu/) project to prepare for mass digitization and dissemination of museums and herbaria across Europe.

I have a particular research interest in introduced plants, their ecology and biogeography. In this context I am Vice Chair of the [Alien-CSI](http://www.cost.eu/COST_Actions/ca/CA17122) COST Action towards monitoring and understanding of invasive species with citizen scientists. I am also leading a TDWG Task Group to improve the Darwin Core standard for its use with invasive species data.

#### Vision statement

We live in exciting times for biodiversity informatics, both a time when we have the capability to do more and better science with information technology, but also a time when the global challenges for biodiversity are extreme. Through my work with TDWG I hope to make new science possible and make a significant contribution to protecting our living heritage. Having learned much in my first two years as TDWG Secretary I hope to be even more effective in my role and in promoting TDWG to a wider audience.

## Nominations for North America representative

### [Annie Simpson](https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8338-5134)

US Geological Survey: Reston, VA, United States

#### Curriculum Vitae

I’ve been active in TDWG since 2002, when I attended an invasive species symposium at the annual meeting in Indaiatuba, Brazil. My interest in the TDWG organization has always been based on our need to make highly technical information consistent and reusable, yet accessible (and understandable) to non-developers. I have a Master’s degree in Entomology and one in Library Science, and I have been working on the development of invasive species information standards since 2004, when the Global Invasive Species Information Network was formed. We worked closely with TDWG experts to create an Invasive Species Interest Group and to begin to develop six schemas for sharing data. My current work is in dataset recruitment for the USGS Biodiversity Information Serving Our Nation ([BISON](https://bison.usgs.gov/)) species occurrence mapping application, and among other things I clean datasets for their inclusion in BISON. A side project that I have led which is coming to fruition is the development of the first comprehensive non-native species list for Alaska, Hawaii, and the 48 conterminous United States. I have attended ten TDWG conferences to date, served on the conference organizing committee for the Bratislava meeting in 2007, and I have confidence TDWG is continuing on the right path to improving the development of biodiversity information standards.

#### Vision

Over the next two years I look forward to becoming part of an Executive Team that continues to facilitate the development global biodiversity information standards in a collaborative and effective way. I believe the Executive’s areas of emphasis should be as follows: developing a better means to become financially independent as an organization; recruiting youth as our future leaders of biodiversity standards development; encouraging broader global participation and diversity of membership; improving our efforts in training on biodiversity information data sharing and standards use; and improving partner organization development for mutually beneficial collaborative work, training, and conferences.
